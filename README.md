# Advanced Deep Learning Techniques for Time Series Prediction in Radiation Detection and Imaging

## Overview

Time series prediction is a crucial component in radiation detection and imaging, where accurate forecasting enhances diagnostic precision and system reliability. Traditional methods such as ARIMA and basic neural networks often struggle with complex temporal dependencies, scalability, and robustness to noise and non-stationary data patterns.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning framework that integrates **Temporal Fusion Networks (TFN)** with an innovative **Dynamic Temporal Optimization Strategy (DTOS)**. This approach is specifically designed for time series data in radiation applications, offering improved predictive accuracy and generalization.

## Key Features

- **Temporal Fusion Network (TFN)**
  - Multi-scale feature extraction
  - Temporal attention mechanisms
  - Hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture
  - Captures both short-term variations and long-term dependencies

- **Dynamic Temporal Optimization Strategy (DTOS)**
  - Adaptive learning rate scheduling
  - Time-series-specific data augmentation techniques
  - Ensemble-based prediction refinement

- **Performance Improvements**
  - Enhanced robustness to noisy and non-stationary data
  - Outperforms traditional methods (e.g., ARIMA, LSTMs) by up to **30%** in key metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **dynamic coverage ratios**
  - Validated on benchmark time series datasets and radiation-specific scenarios
